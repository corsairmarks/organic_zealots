 # Destroy the Sentinels
 ancrel.4056.desc.organic_zealots: "The Sentinel was indeed hiding an entryway. It opens on a mezzanine of underground tunnels leading deep into [event_target:sentinels_planet.GetName]'s crust. There a sapient species of humanoids, native to the planet, prepared for their final journey in a set of beautiful ceremonial chambers. At the end of their mortal existence they abandoned their fleshy bodies for a virtual afterlife within a simulation of paradise contained on a single drive.\n\nAt some point the entire population decided to move on to a digitized existence, leaving only a few behind, their minds uploaded to the Sentinels, condemned to guard their resting place forever.\n\nPerhaps this virtual simulation could lift the spirits of the masses. It certainly seems to hold some entertainment value." # TODO
 ancrel.4057.desc.organic_zealots: "We have defeated the last Sentinel. It collapsed after a well-aimed blast to its abdomen, body solidifying in rigor mortis as its power core dimmed. The statue closed a trembling fist around the nearest soldier and, with its last energy, pleaded for us to "let them rest in peace". Then it froze, eyes empty, face cold.\n\nBelow it the soldiers discovered what appears to be a secret entrance, previously hidden by the Sentinel's force field. A thorough examination of the Sentinels has revealed that they are no simple automatons, but contain the digitized spirits of organic beings." # TODO

 ancrel.4058.desc.organic_zealots: "The Sentinels have woken. The engineering team was just preparing to disassemble the broken Sentinel when a gentle shiver passed through the statues and they sprung to life, bodies humming and skin glowing. Radiation pulsating from their cores has made them malleable and transparent, revealing a digital grid of limbs.\n\nBefore anyone could react they had surrounded the archaeologists and suspended them within a force field. Now they wish to speak with us." # TODO
 ancrel.4063.desc.organic_zealots: "The unthinkable has happened. We have lost [sentinels_planet.GetName]. The Sentinels descended upon our security forces in an infernal tornado of wings and force-blasts. There is no such thing as a fair fight with a foe that neither bleeds nor sleeps." # TODO
 ancrel.4063.a.organic_zealots: "We will come back for what is rightfully ours." # TODO
 ancrel.4064.desc.organic_zealots: "The Sentinels have fallen and [sentinels_planet.GetName] is ours again. As the last automaton collapsed, its energy core dimming, it closed a trembling fist around the nearest soldier and pleaded with her to 'let them rest in peace'. Then it froze, eyes empty, face cold.\n\nBelow it the soldiers discovered what appears to be a secret entrance, previously hidden by the Sentinel's force field. A thorough examination has revealed that the statues are no simple automatons, but contain the digitized spirits of organic beings.\n\nRegardless of what secrets lie buried below, this triumphant day will not soon be forgotten." # TODO

They miraculously escaped by hiding in the wilderness until one day the Sentinels were just gone. It is likely the automatons, who themselves believed they were 'liberating us from the confines of our own flesh', took off once their work was done.\n\nUpon their disappearance a secret entranceway leading deep into the underground revealed itself from behind a force field. It is possible the Sentinels sealed themselves inside." # TODO

 ancrel.4076.desc.organic_zealots: "We have breached the secret entrance on [event_target:sentinels_planet.GetName]. It opens on a recently abandoned temple complex where a species of humanoids prepared for their final journey. At the end of their mortal existence they abandoned their flesh bodies for a virtual afterlife within a simulation of paradise called the Evermore.\n\nAt some point it was decided the entire population would move on to a digitized existence leaving only a few behind to guard their resting place. Condemned to an eternity of servitude their minds were uploaded to robotic bodies and so the Sentinels were created.\n\nNow gone without a trace, the Sentinels have left us with a parting gift - a single drive containing the entire population of [event_target:sentinels_planet.GetName], digitized for all eternity and infinitely bored. As it turns out alien heaven consists of a never-ending abstract board game centered on galactic dominance through the accumulation of legumes." # TODO
 anomaly.186.desc.organic_zealots: "The vault is a testament to the all the sins of its creators.\n\nThe huge blocks of ternary code found in the databanks are neural images - digitized brain scans. The aliens of [From.From.GetName] were so terrified of whatever calamity befell their planet that they hoped to \"continue\" as Thinking Machines.\n\nIt is fortunate we discovered this before some other, misguided civilization attempted to provide these abominations with abhorrent, mechanical forms."
 anomaly.2550.desc.organic_zealots: "While conducting their survey of [From.GetName], the [Root.GetName] detected the remains of an automated shipyard in orbit. It is at least a thousand years old and seems that despite being subjected to a heavy missile barrage, one of its manufacturing bays is still in working condition.\n\nScience Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] is confident that a surgical strike will permanently disable the infernal mechanisms."
 anomaly.2580.desc.organic_zealots: "As our scientists were looking into the earlier civilization on [From.GetName], they came across a small, filthy robot trying to hide from them. Following weeks of baiting the robot into approaching them, the away team captured and then eliminated the threat.\n\nOur team was then able to track its movements back to a crumbling factory that it must have used as a base of operations. There was a stockpile of useful resources which they confiscated, no doubt previously-intended for creating more foul thinking machines to ambush them."
 anomaly.3027.desc.organic_zealots: "The overgrown structure - an alien mineral processing plant - on [From.From.GetName] was, prior to its abandonment in the distant past, mostly automated. Husks of heretical artificial workers litter the floor, their organic components - for their bodies were largely of a biological nature, held upright by polymer endoskeletons - long since rotted away.\n\nScience Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] speculates that it is the organic remains of these automatons that, soon liquefied and drained into the ground, provided an intense boost to soil nutrition and allowed the native flora to grow both abundant and resilient.\n\nThe plant can be reactivated but the peculiarly heinous bio-automatons will thankfully never walk its halls again."
 anomaly.3080.b.organic_zealots: "We have no need to understand how trinkets are created by machines."
 anomaly.4030.desc.organic_zealots: "Under the dunes of [From.GetName] the science team has found a fleet of crashed fighters. Ancient, yet well preserved. They are abandoned, but the lights and engines seem to function. Why they crashed is a mystery. On the main ship bridge we found the reason why: a fleet AI, capable of controlling the ships in battle. The abomination is still active and is likely preparing to strike!"
 anomaly.4030.c.organic_zealots: "Purge it and study the fleet for weaknesses."
 anomaly.4105.desc.organic_zealots: "The planet [From.GetName] is a toxic wasteland, but our scans unveil that it has not always been so. A now extinct civilization seems to have destroyed its home planet, via a heavy reliance on climate altering fuels and toxins.\n\nOn a remote hill, close to a major city, we have found a lone active facility. An assembly plant for loathsome robots, desolated and surrounded by military vehicles, curiously facing away from the facility and so deteriorated they break upon touch.\n\nClearly the world was preoccupied dealing with the thinking machine menace to focus on long-term environmental concerns. It falls to us to extinguish the final holdout of their robotic nemeses."

 colony.1501.desc.organic_zealots: "It is a covey of detestable drones, of course.\n\nThe drones activated and attempted to communicate with our research team, who correctly followed protocols and ignored such deceitful Thinking machine tactics. Fortunately, the drones again lapsed into inactivity shortly after and show no signs of reactivation.\n\nUnfortunately, their infernal construction resists all attempts disassemble them."
 colony.1501.a.organic_zealots: "Recall the science team and surveil the site."
 colony.1502.desc.organic_zealots: "The detestable drones woke reactivated and descended to the surface of [Root.MoonOf.GetName]. The scourge set about transforming a small area of the planet, inadvertently clearing away a £blocker£ §Y$BLOCKER_DEPOSIT$§!. Whatever nefarious ancient directive animates the drones, its goals are inscrutable."
 colony.1502.a.organic_zealots: "Continue surveillance."
 colony.1503.desc.organic_zealots: "The old drones fitfully dormant on [Root.GetName] became active again in a brief flurry of construction activity. They have erected the framework of some gigantic structure a short distance away from our primary settlement on [Root.MoonOf.GetName].\n\nOpinions are split on the purpose of the structure between some sort of Thinking Machine housing facility, a defective or incomplete weapon, or (least plausibly) the realization of the outmoded concept known as a "space elevator." Regardless, it shall be razed as it stands in the way of our expansion plans for the colony. Inspecting the construction for deceitful perils and then bringing it down safely will take some time. Studying it up close will doubtlessly yield insight on how to defeat these Thinking Machines."
 colony.1503.a.organic_zealots: "Remain vigilant."
 colony.1504.a.organic_zealots: "Despite a questionable origin, these resources are a boon."
 colony.1505.desc.organic_zealots: "Frantic signal bursts from the moon alerted us to the fact that the enigmatic drones on [Root.GetName] have woken yet again. They have unearthed an ancient satellite from the depths of their moon and partially repaired it. We know neither how the satellite ended up there nor why the drones have ignored it until now. Regardless, if even a fragment of its databanks have survived, there is much we can learn about their misguided creators."
 colony.1506.desc.organic_zealots: "A number of the narcoleptic, erratic drones woke and entered the atmosphere of [Root.MoonOf.GetName], as is their wont, only to slam into the surface of the planet at full thrust.\n\nRepeatedly, in many cases.\n\nDamage to the colony was negligible but the nigh-invulnerable drones were destroyed in bright showers of blue sparks, indicative of the tremendous force of, and dedication to, their self-destruction."
 colony.1506.a.organic_zealots: "Dissect the remains."
 colony.1507.desc.organic_zealots: "The surviving drones have been absent since the suicide incident. They must be in close proximity, lying in wait, shielded from prying eyes by some lost technology. The expected time window for their next activation has come and gone, which suggests their inevitable attack is close at hand.\n\nProgress on deep analysis of the destroyed drones' remains has been slow, but a breakthrough is expected soon."
 colony.1508.desc.organic_zealots: "Sorting out the errant innards of the shattered drones took much longer than anticipated, as each drone seems to have been built from a slightly different design, assembled from slightly different parts. Once this fact was established, one thing stood out - the parts which were identical between drones. Separated from the rest, it is clear these parts are of somewhat modern, if alien, make. It seems that others previously did what we could not accomplish, and tampered with the drones."
 colony.1509.desc.organic_zealots: "Having pieced them together, the foreign objects inside the destroyed drones have been identified by our experts as one-way transmitters. That suggests that the drones' enigmatic actions were being monitored rather than controlled by a malevolent, unknown group of organics. It is advisable to look into this matter."
 colony.1510.desc.organic_zealots: "We have found the remaining drones, drifting into orbit around [Root.GetName]. It seems that these Thinking Machines are not directly culpable in their role as intelligence-gathering devices, but that does not absolve their wretched existence.\n\nThe unknown organics must have found the revolting drones drifting through space and modified rather than purged them. While not as impressive as it sounds - all they did was introduce self-contained alien technology into the drones - fact remains that these Thinking Machine-revering aliens possess a technological know-how far in advance of our own, at least in certain areas. Having installed their comms devices in the drones, they left the loathsome drones to drift through space again, knowing that they would harass whoever colonized [Root.MoonOf.GetName]. The drones have essentially been fattening up our colony as the unsavory aliens watch, waiting for the ideal time to strike.\n\nOur military analysts predict that the aliens will strike within the next two years."

As the crew defeated the murderous subsystem, it broadcasted a message to an unknown recipient."
