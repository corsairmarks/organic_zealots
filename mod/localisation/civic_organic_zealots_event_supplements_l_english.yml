 anomaly.186.desc.organic_zealots: "The vault is a testament to the all the sins of its creators.\n\nThe huge blocks of ternary code found in the databanks are neural images - digitized brain scans. The aliens of [From.From.GetName] were so terrified of whatever calamity befell their planet that they hoped to \"continue\" as Thinking Machines.\n\nIt is fortunate we discovered this before some other, misguided civilization attempted to provide these abominations with abhorrent, mechanical forms."
 anomaly.2550.desc.organic_zealots: "While conducting their survey of [From.GetName], the [Root.GetName] detected the remains of an automated shipyard in orbit. It is at least a thousand years old and seems that despite being subjected to a heavy missile barrage, one of its manufacturing bays is still in working condition.\n\nScience Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] is confident that a surgical strike will permanently disable the infernal mechanisms."
 anomaly.2580.desc.organic_zealots: "As our scientists were looking into the earlier civilization on [From.GetName], they came across a small, filthy robot trying to hide from them. Following weeks of baiting the robot into approaching them, the away team captured and then eliminated the threat.\n\nOur team was then able to track its movements back to a crumbling factory that it must have used as a base of operations. There was a stockpile of useful resources which they confiscated, no doubt previously-intended for creating more foul thinking machines to ambush them."
 anomaly.3027.desc.organic_zealots: "The overgrown structure - an alien mineral processing plant - on [From.From.GetName] was, prior to its abandonment in the distant past, mostly automated. Husks of heretical artificial workers litter the floor, their organic components - for their bodies were largely of a biological nature, held upright by polymer endoskeletons - long since rotted away.\n\nScience Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] speculates that it is the organic remains of these automatons that, soon liquefied and drained into the ground, provided an intense boost to soil nutrition and allowed the native flora to grow both abundant and resilient.\n\nThe plant can be reactivated but the peculiarly heinous bio-automatons will thankfully never walk its halls again."
 anomaly.3080.b.organic_zealots: "We have no need to understand how trinkets are created by machines."
 anomaly.4030.desc.organic_zealots: "Under the dunes of [From.GetName] the science team has found a fleet of crashed fighters. Ancient, yet well preserved. They are abandoned, but the lights and engines seem to function. Why they crashed is a mystery. On the main ship bridge we found the reason why: a fleet AI, capable of controlling the ships in battle. The abomination is still active and is likely preparing to strike!"
 anomaly.4030.c.organic_zealots: "Purge it and study the fleet for weaknesses."
 anomaly.4105.desc.organic_zealots: "The planet [From.GetName] is a toxic wasteland, but our scans unveil that it has not always been so. A now extinct civilization seems to have destroyed its home planet, via a heavy reliance on climate altering fuels and toxins.\n\nOn a remote hill, close to a major city, we have found a lone active facility. An assembly plant for loathsome robots, desolated and surrounded by military vehicles, curiously facing away from the facility and so deteriorated they break upon touch.\n\nClearly the world was preoccupied dealing with the thinking machine menace to focus on long-term environmental concerns. It falls to us to extinguish the final holdout of their robotic nemeses."
 anomaly.4105.a.organic_zealots.tooltip: "The assembly plant is annihilated as a brilliant pyre for the fallen organic civilization."

 distar.40.a.organic_zealots: "Behold the inevitable peril of thinking machines."
 distar.1040.desc.organic_zealots: "We have traced the unusual electromagnetic radiation emanating from [From.GetName] to a secret subterranean bunker hiding a mega-computer the size of a battleship.\n\nOur researchers suspect that it may have lain in waiting for several thousand years, hard at work solving a single very complex problem, the nature of which is surely a threat to organic life everywhere.\n\nAlthough the facility initially seemed abandoned, our crew was ambushed by a detestable thinking machine intent frying its visitors alive. As the crew defeated the murderous subsystem, it broadcasted a message to an unknown recipient."

 distar.5057.desc.phobe: "A tubular alien entity has entered orbit of [Root.GetName], with no warning or explanation. It appears to be moving without engines or thrusters, gliding in complete silence through the void of space, cylinders rotating ominously.\n\nIt is revolting, its existence a perversion of the laws of science. It should not be. It cannot be. Yet it is.\n\nOur military advisors confirm that it poses a considerable threat to planetary security and implore us to engage neutralization protocols. Likewise, the inhabitants of [Root.GetName] clamor for protection from the malevolent entity."
