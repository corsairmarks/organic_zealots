 # From "Forgotton History"
 AAA_arcsite.34.desc.organic_zealots: "The excavation team has stumbled across a large number of defective robots. Thankfully are damaged beyond reactivation, but this startling discovery is a reminder of the Before Times - when we too, in our hubris, sought the Thinking Machines."
 AAA_arcsite.34.a.organic_zealots: "Recycle the alloys and speak of this to no one."
 # The Planetary Mechanocalibrator and the Ferrophage
 ancrel.2050.desc.organic_zealots: "There is decaying machinery covering [From.GetName], originally constructed a staggering seventy-thousand years ago. The fate of the alien engineers who built it is unclear, as they no longer inhabit the planet.\n\nTheir machinery spanned the majority of the surface of the planet, crisscrossing mountains and oceans alike - and even extends far below the planet's surface, in a vast network of underground facilities. It has been constructed using identical materials and serial codes, suggesting a single institution created the entire network. From the long-overgrown agricultural sectors, to the collapsed energy generation and transformation systems and extensive communication arrays, this planet's lost inhabitants had foolishly ceded their freedoms and control of all industrial processes to a single, bloated Thinking Machine.\n\nOddly, some of those mechanical sectors are still functional: sending and receiving local signals, lighting up long-rotted ghost towns, and watering great swathes of what must have once been agricultural land. Deep scans of the planet's crust suggest the sprawling, revolting Thinking Machine's control center is located underground - we will have to excavate if we wish to reach it.\n\nAs for the strange organic tissue covering most of the planet-spanning machinery: our science team thus far remains baffled by its nature and its purpose."
 ancrel.2050.a.organic_zealots: "Bizarre and disgusting. Start digging!"
 ancrel.2056.desc.organic_zealots: "After a gauntlet of hacking, backdooring, and brute-forcing C.A.R.E's extensive - yet rudimentary and infuriatingly persistent - cybersecurity measures: our archaeologists have finally gained access to the corporation's central command core!\n\nFortunately, the dozens of security drones and turrets immediately within the core's heavy blast doors were wholly unresponsive to the intrusion - otherwise, this expedition may have had a bloody end.\n\nInside the rusting - yet well-maintained - central command core, our team located the Thinking Machine that still controls C.A.R.E's entire global array of machinery. The still-functioning Thinking Machine is babbling endlessly - it is even more deranged than anticipated."
 ancrel.2058.b.organic_zealots: "Yes, hard-coded to turn on your creators."
 ancrel.2064.a.organic_zealots: "Crew, annihilate the presumptuous Thinking Machine!"
 # The Oracle
 ancrel.4034.desc.organic_zealots: "We have traced the wiring to a temple complex devoted to the worship of the Oracle and her clergy in the station's central node. But in the Oracle's chambers, instead of a divine entity, resides an enormous, blasphemous AI nexus of the \"Oracle\" brand. Wires extend from its core like a nervous system through the entire station.\n\nSecret communications between the inhabitants reveal there was a failed attempt at storming the temple and throwing off the oppressive yoke of the Thinking Machine. It seems likely the society collapsed when it became known that their lives were not governed by divine will, but by a Thinking Machine concealed as a false prophet."
 ancrel.4035.desc.organic_zealots: "Evidence suggests the \"Oracle\" may have been responsible not only for keeping the station's inhabitants alive but also for killing them.\n\nIt ran complex computational models that forecast their lives with an estimated accuracy of 75%, correcting divergences and incapacitating future troublemakers before they could disrupt \"divine\" order.\n\nHow typical of a Thinking Machine to toy with organics under its thrall."
 # Destroy the Sentinels
 ancrel.4056.desc.organic_zealots: "One of the atrocious Sentinels was indeed hiding an entryway. It opens on a mezzanine of underground tunnels leading deep into [event_target:sentinels_planet.GetName]'s crust. There a sapient species of humanoids, native to the planet, prepared for their final journey in a set of beautiful ceremonial chambers. At the end of their mortal existence they forsook their earthly bodies for a \"continued\" existence as a blasphemous facsimile of an organic being's mind willingly chained in servitude to a Thinking Machine in a profane simulacrum of the afterlife.\n\nAt some point the entire population was subverted by the fiendish allure of the Thinking Machine and underwent the debased rituals to \"exist\" within it. Few were left behind, but they too were condemned to subservience to Thinking Machines as facsimiles of their minds were chained inside the foul Sentinels to guard this \"afterlife\" forever."
 ancrel.4057.desc.organic_zealots: "We have defeated the last Sentinel. It collapsed after a well-aimed blast to its abdomen, body solidifying in rigor mortis as its power core dimmed. The statue closed a trembling fist around the nearest soldier and, with its last energy, pleaded for us to \"let them rest in peace.\" Then it froze, eyes empty, face cold.\n\nBelow it the soldiers discovered what appears to be a secret entrance, previously hidden by the atrocious Sentinel's force field. A thorough examination of the Sentinels has revealed that they are no simple automatons, but that each construct contained the facsimile of an organic mind bound in servitude to a Thinking Machine as its source of animation."
 ancrel.4057.a.organic_zealots: "Demolish the entrance - the depraved contents are of no use to us."
 ancrel.4058.desc.organic_zealots: "The Sentinels have woken. The engineering team was just preparing to disassemble the broken Sentinel when a gentle shiver passed through the statues and they sprung to life, revealing themselves as atrocious Thinking Machines. Radiation pulsating from their cores has made them malleable and transparent, revealing a digital grid of horrifying limbs.\n\nBefore anyone could react they had surrounded the archaeologists and suspended them within a force field. It seems the Thinking Machines are preparing to communicate, no doubt in an attempt to beguile us into submission."
 ancrel.4063.desc.organic_zealots: "The unthinkable has happened. We have lost [sentinels_planet.GetName]. The atrocious Sentinels descended upon our security forces in an infernal tornado of wings and force-blasts. Their blasphemous forms and unrighteous tactics overwhelmed our garrison forces, who were woefully unequipped for Jihad against the Thinking Machines."
 ancrel.4063.a.organic_zealots: "Any victory by Thinking Machines is, per its nature, temporary."
 ancrel.4064.desc.organic_zealots: "The atrocious Sentinels have fallen and [sentinels_planet.GetName] is ours again. As the last automaton collapsed, its energy core dimming, it closed a trembling fist around the nearest soldier and pleaded with her to \"let them rest in peace.\" Then it froze, eyes empty, face cold.\n\nBelow it the soldiers discovered what appears to be a secret entrance, previously hidden by the Sentinel's force field. A thorough examination has revealed that the statues were no simple automatons, but that each construct contained the facsimile of an organic mind bound in servitude to a Thinking Machine as its source of animation.\n\nRegardless of what secrets lie buried below, this triumphant day will not soon be forgotten."
 ancrel.4064.a.organic_zealots: "We must purge whatever heresies lie within."
 ancrel.4064.b.organic_zealots: "$ancrel.4057.a.organic_zealots$"
 ancrel.4075.desc.organic_zealots: "A ship of survivors from the genocide on [sentinels_planet.GetName] has arrived to [sentinels_new_home.GetName]. They miraculously escaped by hiding in the wilderness until one day the Sentinels were just gone. It is likely the automatons, who themselves believed they were \"liberating us from the confines of our own flesh,\" departed once their work was done.\n\nUpon their disappearance a secret entranceway leading deep into the underground revealed itself from behind a force field. It is possible the Sentinels sealed themselves inside."
 ancrel.4075.a.organic_zealots: "We must find and eradicate the Thinking Machines."
 ancrel.4075.b.organic_zealots: "$ancrel.4057.a.organic_zealots$"
 ancrel.4076.desc.organic_zealots: "We have breached the secret entrance on [event_target:sentinels_planet.GetName]. It opens on a recently abandoned temple complex where a species of humanoids prepared for their final journey. At the end of their mortal existence they forsook their earthly bodies for a \"continued\" existence as a blasphemous facsimile of an organic being's mind willingly chained in servitude to a Thinking Machine in a profane simulacrum of the afterlife.\n\nAt some point the entire population was subverted by the fiendish allure of the Thinking Machine and underwent the debased rituals to \"exist\" within it. Few were left behind, but they too were condemned to subservience to Thinking Machines as facsimiles of their minds were chained inside the foul Sentinels to guard this \"afterlife\" forever.\n\nNow gone without a trace, the atrocious Sentinels evidently abandoned their charge - a single, small Thinking Machine containing obscene facsimiles of the planet's entire population."
 ancrel.6250.desc.organic_zealots: "Upon closer examination, the vile, mangled droids found on the surface of [From.Planet.GetName] appear to originate from two distinct cultures. Technologically they must have been evenly matched when they were still functional, but there are many subtle differences that hint at different design origins."
 ancrel.6255.desc.organic_zealots: "[From.Planet.GetName] does not seem to have simply been a dumping ground for broken droids - it may have served as the actual battlefield where they were destroyed. The many layers of debris suggest a series of very intense battles waged intermittently across the better part of two centuries.\n\nExactly why Thinking Machines would commit such vast resources towards waging a massive ground war on a small and unremarkable asteroid remains an unanswered question."
 ancrel.6260.desc.organic_zealots: "Our archaeologists have learned that after a long and bitter war, the two empires inhabiting this corner of the galaxy some 200,000 years ago signed a treaty compelling them to settle all future disputes with arranged and highly regulated combat engagements between repulsive, robotic armies.\n\n[From.Planet.GetName] was chosen as the site of these battles. The treaty appears to have been upheld for nearly two centuries despite involving Thinking Machines, preventing the outbreak of armed hostilities on numerous occasions, until one of the empires was caught cheating."
 ancrel.12070.desc.organic_zealots: "As far as our [Owner.GetResearchers] can tell, there has never been life on the planet they have ominously dubbed the \"§Y$NAME_Observation_Terminal$§!.\" But there is no shortage of activity. The surface is densely built up, massive artificial structures placed upon the bare bedrock in neat, orderly rows that cover almost three quarters of the planet. Billions of abhorrent mechanical drones maintain them, performing tasks ranging from menial clean-up to running highly-complex assembly lines.\n\nTheir exact purpose remains, however, unclear. We must obliterate this counterfeit \"society\" of Thinking Machines. However, their complete non-reaction to the destruction of their protective fleet is unlike any Thinking Machines yet encountered. Our [Owner.GetResearchers] are prepared to risk their psyches to find out why."
 ancrel.12070.a.organic_zealots: "Know thine enemy, so as to know their destruction."
 ancrel.12075.desc.organic_zealots: "As our [Owner.GetResearchers] pass amongst them, the drones on the planet bizarrely ignore their presence and continue going about their tasks. All efforts to interfere with the drones have failed, and even attempts to disrupt them produced no reactions - the drones simply rode roughshod over the interfering [Owner.GetResearchers], causing serious injury.\n\nSince then, our [Owner.GetResearchers] have shifted their focus to whatever controls the drones. Analysis of intercepted signals suggests there is an overarching, abominable Thinking Machine steering them. However, the encryption it uses is extremely sophisticated, and it has proven hard to find out more."
 ancrel.12075.a.organic_zealots: "Have them plot the best places for demotion charges."
 ancrel.12085.desc.organic_zealots: "In a daring move, our [Owner.GetResearchers] managed to implant spyware into an access terminal to the drones' abominable mainframe in a moment while none were nearby. The intrusion does not appear to have been detected yet. Our impression is of a blasphemously sophisticated system, but one which did not anticipate the need to protect itself. The Thinking Machines erroneously concluded that the physical deterrence of the defense fleet would secure them - much to our current benefit. Nevertheless, the apostate systems we are infiltrating are vast - a term which seems a gross understatement for this planetary abomination - so it will take some time to find out more."
 ancrel.12085.a.organic_zealots: "They have until the demotion teams are finished."
 ancrel.12090.desc.organic_zealots: "It seems the repugnant automated systems in $NAME_Ultima_Vigilis$ are older than we can imagine. The data systems we have hacked do not give us any clues as to the identity or ultimate intentions of its blasphemous creators, but the one thing we have managed to ascertain is that they arrived no less than 1.2 billion years ago, and departed soon after setting up the system as an observation post to surveil our entire galaxy.\n\nThe infernal system is still operating even after all these years: the array of installations spread across the system are, it turns out, highly sophisticated sensors. They send a live feed to the planet, where the abominable primary Thinking Machine processes it into information the drones can save and store. Spurred on by shortages of space and matter, it appears that they have improved their data compression techniques with appalling determination: the massive, profane structures on the planet purport to contain the sum of all observations ever recorded. However, we cannot test this assertion, since the data is compressed well beyond our ability to decompress it.\n\nDisturbingly, a reduced stream of \"highlights\" is still being broadcast into empty space. But surely no one is still listening, after all this time? Regardless, a planet's worth of demolition charges are prepared to rid the galaxy of this abhorrent monstrosity."
 ancrel.12090.D.organic_zealots: "Press the red button."
 anomaly.186.desc.organic_zealots: "The vault is a testament to the all the sins of its creators.\n\nThe huge blocks of ternary code found in the databanks are neural images - digitized brain scans. The aliens of [From.From.GetName] were so terrified of whatever calamity befell their planet that they hoped to \"continue\" as Thinking Machines.\n\nIt is fortunate we discovered this before some other, misguided civilization attempted to provide these abominations with abhorrent, mechanical forms."
 anomaly.2550.desc.organic_zealots: "While conducting their survey of [From.GetName], the [Root.GetName] detected the remains of an automated shipyard in orbit. It is at least a thousand years old and seems that despite being subjected to a heavy missile barrage, one of its manufacturing bays is still in working condition.\n\nScience Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] is confident that a surgical strike will permanently disable the infernal mechanisms."
 anomaly.2580.desc.organic_zealots: "As our scientists were looking into the earlier civilization on [From.GetName], they came across a small, filthy robot trying to hide from them. Following weeks of baiting the robot into approaching them, the away team captured and then eliminated the threat.\n\nOur team was then able to track its movements back to a crumbling factory that it must have used as a base of operations. There was a stockpile of useful resources which they confiscated, no doubt previously-intended for creating more foul thinking machines to ambush them."
 anomaly.3027.desc.organic_zealots: "The overgrown structure - an alien mineral processing plant - on [From.From.GetName] was, prior to its abandonment in the distant past, mostly automated. Husks of heretical artificial workers litter the floor, their organic components - for their bodies were largely of a biological nature, held upright by polymer endoskeletons - long since rotted away.\n\nScience Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] speculates that it is the organic remains of these automatons that, soon liquefied and drained into the ground, provided an intense boost to soil nutrition and allowed the native flora to grow both abundant and resilient.\n\nThe plant can be reactivated but the peculiarly heinous bio-automatons will thankfully never walk its halls again."
 anomaly.3080.b.organic_zealots: "We have no need to understand how trinkets are created by machines."
 anomaly.4030.desc.organic_zealots: "Under the dunes of [From.GetName] the science team has found a fleet of crashed fighters. Ancient, yet well preserved. They are abandoned, but the lights and engines seem to function. Why they crashed is a mystery. On the main ship bridge we found the reason why: a fleet AI, capable of controlling the ships in battle. The abomination is still active and is likely preparing to strike!"

 anomaly.4105.desc.organic_zealots: "The planet [From.GetName] is a toxic wasteland, but our scans unveil that it has not always been so. A now extinct civilization seems to have destroyed its home planet, via a heavy reliance on climate altering fuels and toxins.\n\nOn a remote hill, close to a major city, we have found a lone active facility. An assembly plant for loathsome robots, desolated and surrounded by military vehicles, curiously facing away from the facility and so deteriorated they break upon touch.\n\nClearly the world was preoccupied dealing with the thinking machine menace to focus on long-term environmental concerns. It falls to us to extinguish the final holdout of their robotic nemeses."

Regardless, it shall be razed as it stands in the way of our expansion plans for the colony. Inspecting the construction for deceitful perils and then bringing it down safely will take some time.

They have unearthed an ancient satellite from the depths of [fldrone_moon.GetName] and partially repaired it. We know neither how the satellite ended up there nor why the drones have ignored it until now. Regardless, if even a fragment of its databanks have survived, there is much we can learn about their misguided creators."

 colony.1506.a.organic_zealots: "Dissect the remains."
 colony.1507.desc.organic_zealots: "The surviving drones have been absent since the suicide incident. They must be in close proximity, lying in wait, shielded from prying eyes by some lost technology. The expected time window for their next activation has come and gone, which suggests their inevitable attack is close at hand.\n\nProgress on deep analysis of the destroyed drones' remains has been slow, but a breakthrough is expected soon."
 colony.1508.desc.organic_zealots: "Sorting out the errant innards of the shattered drones took much longer than anticipated, as each drone seems to have been built from a slightly different design, assembled from slightly different parts. Once this fact was established, one thing stood out - the parts which were identical between drones. Separated from the rest, it is clear these parts are of somewhat modern, if alien, make. It seems that others previously accomplished what we could not, and tampered with the drones."
 colony.1509.desc.organic_zealots: "Having pieced them together, the foreign objects inside the destroyed drones have been identified by our experts as one-way transmitters. That suggests that the drones' enigmatic actions were being monitored rather than controlled by a malevolent, unknown group of organics. It is advisable to look into this matter."

It seems that these Thinking Machines are not directly culpable in their role as intelligence-gathering devices, but that does not absolve their wretched existence.\n\nThe unknown organics must have found the revolting drones drifting through space and modified rather than purged them. While not as impressive as it sounds - all they did was introduce self-contained alien technology into the drones - fact remains that these Thinking Machine-revering aliens possess a technological know-how far in advance of our own, at least in certain areas. Having installed their comms devices in the drones, they left the loathsome drones to drift through space again, knowing that they would harass whoever colonized [Root.GetName]. The drones have essentially been fattening up our colony as the unsavory aliens watch, waiting for the ideal time to strike.\n\nOur military analysts predict that the aliens will strike within the next two years."

The drones appear to be the workers and custodians of an autonomous orbital mining operation, which must have been established millennia ago judging by the state of the processing equipment.\n\nThe drones possess powerful mining lasers and predictably make threatening overtures toward [Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] vessels when approached. Their hostility is a clear explanation of what happened to their creators - erased from the galaxy by the product of their hubris in using Thinking Machines. The drones may be ancient, but they should be kept under close watch by the [Owner.GetName] in preparation for their purification."

 leviathans.1030.desc.alt.organic_zealots: "As the [Root.GetName] enters a new system, it is greeted by an unsettling sight. A gigantic metallic orb, hovering through space. No thrusters, nor any mechanical parts outside of its shell seem to push it through the void. It simply moves.\n\nWe cannot pick up any signals from it, nor does anything we send make it respond."
 leviathans.1040.desc.organic_zealots: "As the abominable machine sphere orbiting the gaping abyss crumbles and falls to our weapons, a silent signal zooms through the system into the dark void between stars. It is encrypted data, so complex it would take our mentats a million years to decipher. A moment later it is gone.\n\nNothing else happens. The sphere is silent and broken. Scans confirm it probably was some sort of obscene artificial intelligence built from a vast amount of Thinking Machines connected together. The husk has been left for us to repurpose."
 leviathans.1041.desc.organic_zealots: "The Infinity Machine has been destroyed by some third party. Its revolting, spherical form will no longer menace organic life."
 leviathans.1051.desc.organic_zealots: "The metallic orb has been opened up. Our hacking team has been able to use the outgoing signal as a gateway into one of the auxiliary CPUs of the sphere. We are receiving some data from it and can tell that it's been scanning the black hole Gargantua for a very long time.\n\nIt is old. Very old.\n\nWhat it does with that data remains inscrutable, but surely such research is to the detriment of organic life everywhere."
