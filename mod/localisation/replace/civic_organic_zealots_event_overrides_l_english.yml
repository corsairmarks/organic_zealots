 # Friendly Drones text altered to refer to the moon's name
 colony.1500.desc: "Something stirs on [fldrone_moon.GetName], the moon of [Root.GetName].\n\nPreliminary scans indicate that some ancient technology has become active, possibly as a response to our colonization efforts.\n\nSeveral of our top scientists are eager to take a closer look at the moon, and have prepared a special research project."
 colony.1502.desc: "The drones woke from their slumber and descended to the surface of [Root.GetName]. Attempts to communicate were met with polite dismissal as they set about terraforming a small area of the planet. We do not know the nature of whatever ancient directive they are executing, but it does not seem detrimental to the colony."
 colony.1502.a.tooltip: "The drones remove a random £blocker£ §Y$BLOCKER_DEPOSIT$§! from the surface, leaving the planet otherwise untouched.\n"
 colony.1503.desc: "The old drones fitfully dormant on [fldrone_moon.GetName] have become active again, and their work is a mixed blessing.\n\nUnder the cover of night and spotty airspace surveillance, they have erected the framework of some gigantic structure a short distance away from our primary settlement on [Root.GetName]. Our engineers are convinced it is the realization of some outmoded concept known as a "space elevator," perhaps a common sight in the times before we [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName] first took to the stars. It will eventually have to be razed as it stands in the way of our expansion plans for the colony, and bringing it down safely will take some time. At least our engineers are giddy with excitement at the prospect of studying the thing up close."
 colony.1504.desc: "After waking yet again, the drones briefly disappeared from sensors. When they returned, it was with a large cache of minerals of unknown origin in tow. They dumped it on the surface of [fldrone_moon.GetName] after sending a badly corrupted burst transmission indicating that they had fulfilled a requisition request.\n\nThen they returned to dormancy."
 colony.1505.desc: "Frantic signal bursts from [fldrone_moon.GetName] alerted us to the fact that the old drones have woken yet again. This time they bring us a significant prize, as they have unearthed an ancient satellite from the depths of [fldrone_moon.GetName] and partially repaired it. We do not know how the satellite ended up there, nor why the drones have ignored it until now. Regardless, if even a fragment of its databanks have survived, there is a lot we can learn about day-to-day life in the empires that the drones first served."
 colony.1506.desc: "The erratic behavior of the narcoleptic drones has taken a violent turn. A number of them woke and entered the atmosphere of [Root.GetName], as is their wont, only to slam into the surface of the planet at full thrust.\n\nRepeatedly, in many cases.\n\nDamage to the colony was negligible but the nigh-invulnerable drones were destroyed in bright showers of blue sparks, indicative of the tremendous force of, and dedication to, their self-destruction."
 colony.1510.desc: "We have found the remaining drones, drifting into orbit around [Root.GetName]. We have learned that they are unwitting pawns in an elaborate scheme set up by an unknown faction.\n\nGoing by the modus operandi of this operation, this faction is most likely a particularly old and particularly clever pirate syndicate. They must have found the drones drifting through space and done what we could not; modified them. While not as impressive as it sounds - all they did was introduce self-contained alien technology into the drones - fact remains that these alien pirates possess a technological know-how far in advance of our own, at least in certain areas. Having installed their comms devices in the drones, the pirates let them drift through space again, knowing that they are set to assist their original masters' colonists and that the drones' ability to accurately identify such colonists has degraded with age. The drones have essentially been fattening up our colony as the pirates watch, waiting for the ideal time to strike.\n\nOur military analysts predict that the pirates will strike within the next two years."
