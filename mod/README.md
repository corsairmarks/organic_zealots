### Development Notes

It is best to clone this repository into `<Stellaris User's Directory>/Paradox Interactive/Stellaris/mod`, and then make a connection to the `mod` folder via a `*.mod` file's `path` property.  That will ensure the game can see the files, and also that CWTools will parse them.  Also note that the README.md file exists in the `mod` directory but is symbolically linked in the root directory.




Overrides

* ap_the_flesh_is_weak - disallowed for civic_organic_zealots (hate machines)
* ap_nihilistic_acquisition - disallowed civic_organic_zealots (no homicidals can take this)
* ap_colossus - bonus weight for civic_organic_zealots (same as civic_fanatic_purifiers and civic_determined_exterminators)
